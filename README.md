## Update KeeleGuesser25.1

Lots and lots of bug fixes... "test is prod" is very powerful. 

#### New Features:
- Now location is dependent on your subdomain. Simply enter <location>.keeleguesser.beer and you will be set to that. You can always go to keeleguesser.beer for a standard session though!
- Emails can be found for both bug-fixes and support to logged in users.

#### Fixes:
- You can no longer keep guessing as much as you want.
- The Perfect Streak leaderboard actually works
